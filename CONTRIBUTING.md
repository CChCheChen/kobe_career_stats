### Core Team Contribution

Development employs proper branching when contributing to the project, and makes use of branch protection rules when submitting a pull request (PR).  I was able to review and accept (or close) these PRs, with some new discoveries during the review. Furthermore, I am able to create issues and discussions as it promotes proper development collaboration.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
